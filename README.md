# It's the Game of Life. From Birth 'till Death.

2-dimensional world, where the rabbits live.
On every spot of the world (gridpoint) is a chance to let a rabbit live.
After every step in time rabbits are born, live their life, and die.
Rabbits only die because of over- or underpopulation, which means their must live exactly 2 rabbits on surrounding places to let everybody keep comfy.
If there is a place, where no rabbit lives but two rabbits live nearby (neighbours) just out of nowhere a rabbit is born.

And thats all the rules.

The setting is made via Inputfile, if a random starting situation is wished, it souhld be possible to start with only the domainsize, number of rabbits alive and the maximum time to be simulated.
